Title of Article : Uncovering the impact of morphology of porous media and capillary number on immiscible oil recovery using computational fluid dynamics 
This repository contains simulation cases conducted using OpenFOAM 5.x on a range of digital rocks. These cases are publicly accessible to researchers, providing all simulation results in the form of Excel datasets, plots, and codes for different scenarios.

We hope that this repository will be a valuable resource for researchers, professors, and students alike.
